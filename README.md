# GetPQ
  A very bare bones PBI Tool to help with Power Query Coding in Power BI Desktop.
## Installation
+ Download the zip file from the latest releases.
+ Unzip the folder, place the folder in a location that makes sense.
+ Run InstallPBITool.ps1 (right-click, Run with Powershell). This installs a json file that sets up a connection with PBI Desktop. Important: Run from within the GetPQ folder **after** moving it.
+ Once done, this will be visible as an external tool in Power BI Desktop.
